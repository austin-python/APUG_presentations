# Austin Python Users Group

Austin Python is one of the world's most active Python meetups, and currently has a meetup.com membership of over 6,000 members. The users group hosts several meetups, including the Austin python monthly meetup and the evening of python coding. The rest of the document will focus on the Austin Python Monthly meetup while details on the Evening of Python Coding can be found [here](https://github.com/austin-python/APUG_presentations/blob/master/EveningOfPythonCoding.md)

The Austin Python Monthly meetup has been meeting monthly for over 12 years in downtown Austin, and our average meetup turnout is around 70 people, with the first few months of the year peaking at 90-100 people.

Our meetups have different content each month, and range across topics of interest to the Python community.  The meetups run for about 1.5 - 2 hours. The cost of sponsorship goes directly to cover the cost of food and drink, typically pizza and beer/soda.  If a sponsor would like to directly furnish these at an equivalent cost level, we can discuss it on a case-by-case basis.

## Sponsorship for the monthly python meetup

Sponsoring our meetups is a good way to raise your corporate visibility in the Austin technical community, to help with sourcing and retaining technical employees, and to give back to the community in a way that will make your technical employees proud of their employer

Sponsoring a single meeting means paying for food and refreshments, at cost (typically $600 to $800).  You can pay these expenses directly, or one of our group leaders can pay and invoice you or submit an expense claim.  One of our group leaders will take care of the ordering & delivery process, or we can work with you to do the same.

#### Single Meeting Sponsor: $600 - $800 for one meeting
- Shout-out in meeting announcement
- Listing & brief paragraph in the particular month's meetup page
- Chance to address the membership for a few minutes at the start of the meetup
- Opportunity to set up table with brochures, swag on the night of the meetup
- Signage right next to the food + refreshments saying "Provided by <your company>"

If you are willing to commit to sponsor multiple meetings per year, then we can offer additional benefits.

#### Multiple Meeting Sponsor: $3,000 for 3 meetings per year
- All of the single meeting sponsor recognition at the specific meetings you sponsor, plus...
- Acknowledgment and recognition at every meeting, and on the group meetup page

## Recruiting Policy for the Austin Python Monthly meetup

Our organization exists to serve the Austin Python community, and we don't want to put any artificial barriers between our members and your desire to hire them.  If you have jobs you want to promote, you are welcome to come to our meetings and announce them, and sponsorship is not required.

But our organization is not intended to help 3rd party recruiters find candidates.  We allow free access to our membership only when we're connecting people with specific jobs + companies.  Opportunities should be presented by hiring managers (best), current team members (ideal), or HR employees or contractors working for the company actually doing the hiring.  3rd party recruiters are asked to sponsor meetings if they want to get access to our membership.
